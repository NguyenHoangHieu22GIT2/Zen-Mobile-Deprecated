# Zen-Mobile

### This is a mobile version of Zen, Use react-native (expo) to build it.

This is my first project using React Native, so beware this will have a lot of bugs. But I will try my best to minimize the bugs of course.

You can clone it and do whatever you want. This is my project for school so it doesn't mean much to be honest, it is just there to show my works and to see how far I accomplised stuff :D
